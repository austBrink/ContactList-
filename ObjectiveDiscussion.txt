# ContactList- 
Objective: investigate and develop command over ArrayList objects

Thanks for stopping by! 

The included source files are the code from a homework project in Java. 
The primary objective is stated the description (sub title). 
Overall, I'd say the result satisfies the objective.  >.< XD :)   

In addition to the cope of the challenge was the making of looped "menu's" simulated by user inputs and outputs. 

Objectives for future consideration: 
* Add output instructions after adding new contact (details in "MobilePhone")
* Integrate quit (break) options for inner menus (loops)
* Create and employ alphabetize method and menu option 
* Create and employ search for contact via contacts phone number into menu 
* Research and consider employment of saving added contacts to file. 
* Handle exceptions in menu for specificity (currently crashable menu loops) (more on this later)
